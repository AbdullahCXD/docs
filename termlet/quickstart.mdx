# Termlet.js

**Termlet **is a lightweight markup language designed for building terminal-based projects using an HTML-like syntax written in XML. It’s a playful and expressive tool for developers who enjoy crafting terminal interfaces with structure and clarity.\
\
This project isn’t built with popularity in mind—but if it resonates with others, that’s a welcome bonus.

## Features

- **HTML-like syntax**: Write terminal UIs using familiar markup convetions
- **XML-based structure**: Clean and readable formatting for terminal components
- **TypeScript-powered**: Strong typing and modern tooling for development
- **Built with Bun.js**: Fast runtime and tooling for optimal performance

To use Termlet, you can install it with:

npm:

```sh
npm install --location=global termlet.js@latest
```

yarn:

```

pnpm:

```sh
pnpm install -g termlet.js@latest
```

Then to check if it's installed correctly and successfully:
