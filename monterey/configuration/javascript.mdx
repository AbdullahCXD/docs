## Raw JavaScript Implementation

<ParamField path="top" type="string" required={false}>
  Places to the top, raw implemented JS code that is executed.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="end" type="string" required={false}>
  Places to the end, raw implemented JS code that is executed.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="async" type="booelan" required={false}>
  Changes between asynchronous and synchronized execution.



  ```javascript
  /* Top Level Implemented code with async */
  (async () => {
    <top_field>
  });

  /* Top Level Implemented code with sync */
  (() => {
    <top_field>
  });
  ```

  This goes for end as well, this field connects to the both fields: `top`,`end`
</ParamField>
